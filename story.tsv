0	A hissing sound and a rush of cool air is what you awake to as your pod opens for the first time in a hundred and seventy-eight years.	Do you (1) push your pod hatch open fully and step out onto the rest of the ship or (2) feel the ache in your bones from the cold of space and being in cryosleep for so long, and go back to sleep?	0.1,0.2
0.1	You're not the only one awake. All the pods have opened and some of your fellow shipmates stumble out as well. A boy yawns, wandering toward the window facing the blackness of space. A girl rubs the sleep out of her eyes and crouches down by her pod and begins to tap at the user panel. And a man, who already seems completely awake, walks towards the sealed doors at the end of the hall.	Do you (1) follow the boy to the window, (2) see what the girl is doing with her pod, or (3) follow the man to the door?	1.1,1.2,1.3
0.2,1.3.1.1,1.3.2.2	The next time you wake, it is by shaking all around. The screen on the inside of your pod flashes yellow, orange, and red on a loop.	Do you (1) push against your pod hatch, trying to escape, or (2) tap your pod screen and try to figure out what's wrong from inside?	2.1,2.2
1.1,1.2.2.2	"Where's Alpha-28?" the boy mumbles. "Aren't we there yet? We're only supposed to wake up when we get there..." \n "Where are we if not on Alpha-28?" you ask him. \n He taps the window and a screen with a map comes to life. "We're still another fifty lightyears out! Do we have enough supplies to last that long?"	Do you (1) pull up a map of the ship to begin searching for inventory or (2) suggest you try to fix your pods so you can go back to sleep?	1.1.1,1.1.2
1.2,1.1.2,1.1.1.1	You walk towards the girl fiddling with her pod's user panel and ask her what she's doing. \n "I'm trying to fix it. It must be broken and that's why it woke us up fifty lightyears away from Alpha-28," she said. \n "Yours isn't the only broken pod, then," you say. "The problem must be in the main control room." \n You both head to the sealed door at the end of the hall and it opens automatically to let you through. You follow the signs to the main control room. The man who left earlier is sitting there with an angry look on his face.	Do you (1) approach the man and ask him what's wrong or (2) suggest that you come back later?	1.2.1,1.2.2
1.3,1.2.1,1.2.2.1,1.1.1.2	The man shows you the problem. Someone changed the date of arrival and there is a puzzle that must be solved to change it back. Beside the changed date, there are six numbers: 342113, but there's no indication what to do with them. \n "34, 21, and 13 are part of the Fibonacci sequence," you realize. \n You quickly type in the remaining numbers of Fibonacci: 853211. The date field unlocks and the man shakes your hand before resetting it. You both return to the pod area and inform the other passengers that they can return to sleep.	n/a	0.2
2.1	The pod hatch bursts open and you tumble out into the hallway, but your limbs never touch the ground. You are suspended, weightless, and then the ship rattles like a can again and you land on the ground on all fours. You see several passengers who've also awoken crowding around the window while others stream towards the automatic door at the end of the hall.	Do you (1) join the passengers at the window or (2) join the passengers heading out the door?	2.1.1,2.1.2
2.2	The words "crash iminent" flash across the screen. 	Do you (1) stay put in your sealed pod or (2) try to make it to your escape pod?	2.2.1,2.2.2
1.1.1	You pull up a map of the ship on the window screen. "Here. These are the supply bays. Let's go!" \n The boy stops you, discouraged. "Can't you already see it isn't large enough to hold more than what we'll need on Alpha-28? Even if we manage to make it last until we arrive, we'll die there instead."	Do you (1) try to find a way to fix your pods or (2) look for the man who seems to be awake enough to know what he's doing?	1.1.1.1,1.1.1.2
1.2.2	"Don't be a scaredy cat!" says the girl. "Come on."	Do you (1) follow the girl and approach the man or (2) go back to the pod area and approach the boy you saw at the window?	1.2.2.1,1.2.2.2
2.1.1	You see a massive blue and green planet hurtling towards you at high speeds â€” too fast for a safe landing. The heat from the atmosphere turns the periphery of the window yellow, orange, and red, before the glass shatters all at once. That is the last thing you remember.	The end.	0
2.2.1	You shut your eyes and wait for the shaking to stop, but it doesn't. Suddenly, there is a loud crash and you feel weightless. You open your eyes and are faced with the blackness of space, left to wonder what will get to you first, the elements, the hunger, or the thirst? 	The end.	0
2.1.2,2.2.2	You waste no time following the crowd of other passengers down the hall and to the escape pods. You strap yourself into the one with the number matching the one sewn into your jumpsuit. It auto-ejects and after what feels like several fearful hours, but really was only thirty minutes, you feel the booster jets kick in to bring you to a safe landing on your new home, Alpha-28.	The end.	0
